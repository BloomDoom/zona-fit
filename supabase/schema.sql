-- Zona Fit: database schema (everything in one file).
-- Run this once in Supabase → SQL Editor → New query → paste → Run.
--
-- Conventions:
--   * Money is stored as whole pesos (integer). No centavos.
--   * Months are stored as a date on the 1st (2026-03-01 = March 2026).
--   * Weekdays: 1 = Monday ... 7 = Sunday (ISO standard).
--   * Payments, charges, absences and sales are never deleted: they get a
--     deleted_at timestamp instead ("soft delete"), so history survives.
--   * Table and column names are in English (like the code); everything
--     Nadia reads on screen is in Spanish.
